### Module Menu via json for Joomla 3>

This module creates a json file of menu based on menu of joomla.

With this json we can call menu mobile just when we need.

The proposal was to optimize the maximum of files to load.

In this case I am using just when I resize for tablet or mobile, but can be use for any size.

To do the menu mobile with hamburguer example I use http://mmenu.frebsite.nl/download.html

To save menu I use jstorage (http://www.jstorage.info/); 

You can find css and js require to work in path js and css.

###How to Install //// Como instalar

1. Download zip file.

2. Upload to joomla.

3. Now you need to create a module, the best place to include is in the navbar or nav.
